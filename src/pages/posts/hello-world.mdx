Hello, world! Welcome to the first issue of _This Week in Godot_, a weekly overview of what happened the last week in the Godot engine and its community right in your email. I'll try to cover the most relevant news, releases, games, tools, and anything else relevant. Please, if you have any recommendations or, any idea you can send me an email to jose@albizures.com or, even better, you can make a PR in [GitHub](https://github.com/albizures/ThisWeekInGodot).
